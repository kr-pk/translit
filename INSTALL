TRANSLIT INSTALLATION
     Program is given in the source form. It was tried under  UN*X,
     VMS and MS-DOS systems and ran. The file readme.doc contains
     the details on how to obtain  the  whole  package.  You  can
     retrieve  this  file from anonymous ftp on www.ccl.net in
     the directory /pub/russian/translit.  You can also obtain it
     via e-mail by sending a message:
       get translit/readme.doc from russian
     to OSCPOST@ccl.net or OSCPOST@OHSTPY.BITNET.

     The source of the program consists of several files:

     paths.h
          must be edited before compilation. It contains its  own
          comments what to do. The defines in this file relate to
          the operating system you are using and the default path
          for searching transliteration table.

     translit.c
          It contains the main program.  This was intended to  be
          a portable code.

     reg_exp.h
          the  include  file  for  regular  expression   matching
          library   of  Henry  Spencer  from  the  University  of
          Toronto. This regular expression package was posted  to
          comp.sources.misc  (volume  3).  Also  4  patches  were
          posted (in volumes: 3, 4, 4, 10). I applied the patches
          to  the  original  code and made small modifications to
          the code, which are marked in the source code.

     reg_exp.c
          the regular  expression  library  for  compilation  and
          matching of regular expressions.

     reg_sub.c
          the regular expression substitution routine.


     Before you compile this program you have  to  edit  paths.h.
     Read  comments  in the file.  During compilation, all source
     code should reside in the current directory.
     Then you may compile the program under UN*X  as  (for  exam-
     ple):
       cc -o translit translit.c reg_exp.c reg_sub.c
     and copy the program translit  to  some  standard  directory
     which  is in users' path (for example: /usr/local/bin). Then
     you need to copy transliteration  tables  to  the  directory
     which  you  have chosen in paths.h.  If you get errors, then
     it is not OK. Please, report them to the  author  (with  all
     the  gory  details:  error  message,  line  number, machine,
     operating system, etc.).

     Under VMS (VAXes) you need to compile it as:
       cc translit
       cc reg_exp
       cc reg_sub
       link translit+reg_exp+reg_sub,sys$library:vaxcrtl/lib
     and before you can use the program, you  need  to  type  (or
     better put into your LOGIN.COM file) a line:
       translit == "$SYS$USER:[ME.TRA]TRANSLIT.EXE"
     or whatever is the full  path  to  the  translit  executable
     image which you created with LINK. Note the quotes and the $
     sign in front of program path.

     On an IBM-PC I used MicroSoft C 5.1 as:
      cl /FeTRANSLIT /AL /FPc /W1  /F  5000  /Ox  /Gs  translit.c
       reg_exp.c reg_sub.c

     You can also use "make" if you have it. Two ready to run 
     Makefiles are included:
        Makefile.unx       (for UNIX)
        Makefile.os2       (for OS/2)
     You need to give the following commands
        make -f Makefile.xxx 
        make -f Makefile.xxx  clean
     where Makefile.xxx is the Makefile corresponding to your system.
     Then you need to copy the TRANSLIT to the directory in your PATH,
     and transliteration tables (*.rus) to the directory chosen as TPATH
     in paths.h.
