# File koi7_8.rus

# This is a transliteration data file for converting from KOI7 to
# KOI8 (RELCOM-GOST 19768-74). The KOI7 character codes for Russian letters
# overlap with Latin letters. To mark what is in Russian and what in English,
# The SHIFT-OUT and SHIFT-IN characters are used: The SHIFT-OUT and SHIFT-IN 
# switch between Latin and Russian character set. The SHIFT-OUT switches
# to Russian letters. If the sequence of Russian characters does not start
# with the SHIFT-OUT character, it will be treated as English text!
# The SHIFT-OUT character is CTRL-N (\14 = \0x0E = \0o16).
# The SHIFT-IN character is CTRL-O (\15 = \0x0F = \0o17). It switches back to
# Latin characters. 
# If the SHIFT-OUT character is not present, whole file is assumed to be
# written in Latin alphabet.
# On the practical side: The KOI7 characters are frequently obtained
# from KOI8 character set as a result of transmission through the network.
# In most cases, the electronic-mail strips the 8th bit of KOI8 character
# set changing it to KOI7. The problem is that in this case, there is no
# SHIFT-IN and SHIFT-OUT codes to signal which characters are Latin and
# which are Russian. In this case, buy using the editor, YOU HAVE TO ENCLOSE
# RUSSIAN TEXT inside the appropriate SHIFT-OUT and SHIFT-IN sequence.
# To obtain a true KOI7 file, these should be CTRL-N and CTRL-O, respectively.
# However, It is sometimes difficult to obtain this control characters within
# an editor. In this case, you may use your own character, but they should
# not apear elsewhere in the text. Unfortunately, most "good" characters
# are taken. I think that it is better to use a two-character sequence in
# this situation. You are free to use your own, but I would suggest that you
# stick with {{ (as SHIFT-OUT) and }} as SHIFT-IN (they correspoind to:
# sh-sh and shch-shch in KOI7). Of course, if they appear in your KOI7
# text you need to use something else. To use these characters, you need to
# make following changes in the section of this file where input SHIFT-OUT/IN
# sequences are read in:
# 1) uncomment (i.e., delete # character in the first column):
#  #   "{{"    ""    ""    ""    "}}"      ""         # Russian letters {{...}}
# 2) comment (i.e., put # in the first column)
#  "\0x0E"  ""    ""    ""    "\0x0F"   ""         # Russian letters ^N...^O
