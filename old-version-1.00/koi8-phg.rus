# This is a transliteration data file for converting from
# KOI8 as used by RELCOM to transliteration defined in the GOST 16876-71
# standard.
# Since I never had a chance to look at the GOST 16876-71 document,
# the actual table is based on the info which I read on some list
# (I believe it was posted by Glenn Thobe on RUS-TEX)
# To be used with translit.c program by Jan Labanowski
