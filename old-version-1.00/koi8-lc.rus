# File koi8-lc.dat

# This is a transliteration data file for converting from KOI-8 as used
# by RELCOM (GOST 19768-74) to approximate Library of Congress (phonetic)
# transliteration. I personally think, that LC transliteration is a bad one.
# It is not possible to exactly represent Library of Congress transliteration
# since it uses the accented letters which are not present in the ASCII
# character set. Several changes are made to the letter of LC.
# The English text has to be embraced in braces {}, while
# the Russian one, is outside the braces.
# To be used with translit.c program by Jan Labanowski. For a format of
# this file consult translit documentation.
