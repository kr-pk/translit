# File koi8_7.rus

# This is a transliteration data file for converting from  KOI8 (RELCOM,
# GOST 19768-74) to KOI7. The KOI7 character codes for Russian letters
# overlap with Latin letters. To mark what is in Russian and what in English,
# The SHIFT-OUT and SHIFT-IN characters are used. The SHIFT-OUT and SHIFT-IN 
# switch between Latin and Russian character set. The SHIFT-OUT switches
# to Russian letters. 
# The SHIFT-OUT character is CTRL-N (\14 = \0x0E = \0o16).
# The SHIFT-IN character is CTRL-O (\15 = \0x0F = \0o17). It switches back to
# Latin characters. You might want to read comments in file koi7_8.rus
